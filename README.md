# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Betting-Strategy

**Reinforcement Learning for Betting Strategy**

The implementation of a reinforcement learning-based betting strategy using the Stable-Baselines3 library and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The goal is to train a model to make betting decisions based on historical data, and then evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset.



1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Imports necessary libraries including Gym, Pandas, and Stable-Baselines3.
   - Defines hyperparameters and loads the historical dataset for training.
   - Creates a custom Gym environment (`BettingEnvironment`) for the betting scenario.

2. **Training the PPO Model:**
   - Initializes the PPO model using the defined environment.
   - Performs training over a specified number of epochs, collecting trajectories and updating the model.
   - Saves the trained PPO model for future use.

3. **Testing and Evaluation:**
   - Defines a new Gym environment for testing using a separate test dataset.
   - Loads the pre-trained PPO model and evaluates its performance on the test dataset.
   - Calculates and plots metrics such as episode rewards, mean rewards, and profit percentage increase over time.

4. **Predictions and Visualization:**
   - Uses the trained model to predict bet amounts on a new dataset (`prediction_data`).
   - Saves the predicted bet amounts and the entire dataset with predictions to CSV files.
   - Visualizes the testing results, including episode rewards, mean rewards, and profit percentage increase, providing insights into the model's behavior.

5. **Conclusion and Future Work:**
   - Summarizes the key findings and performance metrics of the trained model.
   - Suggests potential areas for improvement or future exploration, such as hyperparameter tuning or using different reinforcement learning algorithms.


A comprehensive workflow for developing, training, and evaluating a reinforcement learning model for a betting strategy. You can adapt the provided code for their specific datasets and experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
